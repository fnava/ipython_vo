Personal notes regarding Virtual Observatory usage through python.

Libraries tested so far:
*  [pyVO](http://pyvo.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) a quick and easy way to start using VO
 * [Introduction](https://github.com/fnava/ipython_vo/blob/master/first_vosample.ipynb) quick sample of usage. 
 * [Tutorial 1](https://github.com/fnava/ipython_vo/blob/master/pyvo-tutorial1.ipynb) to discover archives, search and download images.
 * [Tutorial 2]() for simple image treatment, following published VO tutorials.
